% Open with a captivating introductory sentence, name the position you're

\begin{bp}
I recently learned about the opening for a Social Media Security and Compliance
Intern through LinkedIn's internship page. After further exploring
TCI's webpage, I found the techniques and services provided by the Teacher's
Curriculum Institute to be impressive in their utilization of technology in
educating K-12 classrooms. As someone who is interested in providing
interactive educational materials, I feel that this position would suit me
well. Furthermore, I am an impassioned and quick learner, as recently
demonstrated with delivering a lauded project which required learning
Javascript, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5 in a matter of five weeks.
I believe my skillset would help facilitate work on current projects at TCI
necessitating strong front end design. With this, and my ability to adapt to
different situations, I would be able to benefit a variety of projects.

As a long-time tutor, I also understand the importance of tools which assist
in engaging students of all different learning styles. Working with people of
varying demographics provided firsthand experience with catering lessons in

participating in MOOCs to supplement my education, that I became thoroughly
interested in utilizing technology to further education.
