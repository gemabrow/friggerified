# About
A version of Adrien Friggeri's CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print publications and textpos for the aside.
## Additions by gemabrow
Updated frigerri-cv.cls for changes made to XeTeX, and created frigerri-coverletter.cls for a cover letter in the same style as friggeri-cv.

Run with xelatex. If header fails to appear to appear in resultant pdf, rerun xelatex.
